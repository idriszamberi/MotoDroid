# MotoDroid
This application was developed back in 2015 during my Final Year Project.

We are building an electric motorcycle that use Arduino as the brain of the paramaters.

This app is used to monitor parameter like motor temperature, speed, lights control and killswitch.

It connect to the arduino by bluetooth module and sends signal for every parameters you would like to perform.
